# 1. Setup
zip_path ← path to .zip containing .dcm images
tmp_dir ← make temporary directory
extract zip_path into tmp_dir
DATA_DIR ← tmp_dir
FILES ← sorted list of files in DATA_DIR

# 2. Compute beam CAX
IMG1 ← pixel array of FILES[0]
IMG2 ← pixel array of FILES[1]
C1 ← centroid of pixels ≥50% max intensity in IMG1
C2 ← centroid of pixels ≥50% max intensity in IMG2
beam_CAX ← midpoint of C1 and C2 (swap to (x,y) order)

# 3. Prepare lists for storing results
jaw_pos_list ← []
figures ← []

# 4. Process each jaw image not used to calc the MV CAX
for FILE in FILES[2:]:
    ds ← read DICOM FILE
    img ← ds.pixel_array
    normalize img to [0,1]
    if ds.BeamLimitingDeviceAngle ≈ 270: # If col was rotated 
        img ← transpose img
        this_CAX ← swap beam_CAX
    else:
        this_CAX ← beam_CAX

    # detect jaw positions/edges
    for each (axis, direction) in [(x,–),(x,+),(y,–),(y,+)]:
        scan central 60% of rows or columns  # avoid primary col shadow
        at each slice, find first pixel ≥50% of img max on given side
        collect valid slice indices, take their median
        convert that median pixel index to mm via this_CAX and DICOM spacing
        record edge_idx and edge_mm

    # get planned jaw positions from ds
    (x1,x2,y1,y2) ← ds.ExposureSequence…LeafJawPositions

    append ((x1,x2,y1,y2), (x1_edge_mm,x2_edge_mm,y1_edge_mm,y2_edge_mm))
        to jaw_pos_list

    # plot and annotate for pdf report
    create figure, show img
    draw vertical lines at x1_edge, x2_edge; horizontal at y1_edge, y2_edge
    label each with Meas, Plan, Diff
    add figure to figures

# 5. Build summary data & QA-Track dict
summary_data ← []
qat_dict ← {}
for (plan_coords, meas_coords) in jaw_pos_list:
    diffs ← meas_coords – plan_coords
    append formatted diffs to summary_data
    for jaw_str, plan, meas in zip(["X1","X2","Y1","Y2"], plan_coords, meas_coords):
        key ← jaw_str + " " + round(plan/10)
        append (meas – plan) to qat_dict[key]
for each key in qat_dict:
    qat_dict[key] ← max absolute value of its list

# 6. Create summary figure
max_diffs ← max absolute values per jaw from summary_data
create figure 
add title and text reporting max_diffs
add table with summary_data and headers ["X1 Diff","X2 Diff","Y1 Diff","Y2 Diff"]

# 7. Write PDF report
open PDF at output path
save summary figure
for fig in figures: save fig
close PDF
