# 1. Setup
DATA_DIR ← path to folder of files
FILES ← sorted list of files in DATA_DIR

# 2. Compute beam central axis (CAX)
IMG1, IMG2 ← pixel arrays from first two DICOMs, corrected for any outlier pixels
C1, C2 ← centroids of high-intensity regions in IMG1 and IMG2
beam_CAX ← midpoint of C1 and C2 (swap to (x,y) order)

# 3. Determine EPID-to-MLC rotation
COMB1, COMB2 ← pixel arrays from next two DICOMs, corrected for any outlier pixels
ROT1 ← avg angle calculated by comparing opposing leaf positions (leaf N from bank A vs bank B) from COMB1
ROT2 ← same for COMB2
rot_angle ← average(ROT1, ROT2)

# 4. Establish baseline leaf indices
ROTATED_COMB1 ← rotate COMB1 by rot_angle
LEAF_INDICES ← positions of peaks in intensity profile of ROTATED_COMB1
leaf_axis ← axis perpendicular to direction of leaf travel

# 5. Load planned MLC positions
if machine is RTUS:
    PLANNED_POS ← predefined RTUS MLC leaf positions
else:
    PLANNED_POS ← predefined 120MLC MLC leaf positions

# 6. Initialize lists to store results
all_errors, alerts, worst_A, worst_B, figures_list ← empty

# 7. For each remaining QA image, i.e., for non-MV-CAX and non-COMB images
for each FILE in FILES[4:]:
    img ← read and rotate pixel array by rot_angle
    normalize img to [0,1] and correct any outlier pixels

    # 7a. Measure each leaf’s position
    for each index in LEAF_INDICES:
        detect edge pixel along leaf_axis at 50% intensity
        convert pixel index to mm relative to beam_CAX
        collect positions for Bank A and Bank B

    # 7b. Compute per-leaf errors
    A_errors ← measured_A_mm – PLANNED_POS[A_row]
    B_errors ← measured_B_mm – PLANNED_POS[B_row]
    record abs(errors) in all_errors
    flag any >2 mm as ALERT, >5 mm as ACTION ALERT (append to alerts)
    record worst leaf for each bank (append to worst_A, worst_B)

    # 7c. Build and store figure:
    #   - grayscale image with detected jaw edges + text
    #   - bar charts of A_errors and B_errors, highlighting worst
    add figure to figures_list

# 8. Create summary figure
display all alerts with color coding
compute and display max(all_errors) and mean(all_errors)

# 9. Build QA-Track dictionary
for each recorded (measured_A_mm, measured_B_mm, plan_A, plan_B):
    key ← "<median plan A> <negative median plan B>"
    value ← (max deviation A, max deviation B)
    add to qat_dict[key] = value

# 10. Write PDF report
open PDF at output path
save summary figure, then each figure in figures_list
close PDF
